# Causal_Inference_For_Confounding_Variable

## Causal Inference for Confounding Variables
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the concept of confounding variables in causal inference. The notebook provides both theoretical explanations and practical coding examples to help identify and adjust for the effects of confounding variables in research and data analysis.

## Overview
Confounding variables can significantly distort the relationships between variables, leading to inaccurate conclusions. This notebook introduces the following concepts:

1. Causal Inference: The process of determining cause-and-effect relationships between variables.
2. Confounding Variables: Variables that obscure the true relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
3. Identification and Adjustment: Methods for identifying confounding variables and adjusting for their effects to obtain accurate and reliable conclusions.
   
## Key Sections:
1. Abstract: An introduction to the importance of addressing confounding variables in research and decision-making.
2. Understanding Variables in Causal Inference: Explains the primary types of variables involved in causal analysis:
Independent Variable (the presumed cause)
Dependent Variable (the observed effect)
Confounding Variables (those that may distort the true relationship)
3. Case Studies: Two practical case studies are included to demonstrate the impact of confounding variables and the methods to account for them.
   
## Features
Theoretical explanations of causal inference concepts.
Practical coding examples for identifying and adjusting for confounders.
Two case studies highlighting the real-world impact of confounding variables on research conclusions.
